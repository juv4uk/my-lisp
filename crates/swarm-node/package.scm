;; Real Guix package definition for swarm-node -- GUIX-WITNESS-01 step 1.
;;
;; swarm-node was chosen as the first real package (over the full my-lisp
;; workspace) specifically because its own Cargo.toml declares zero
;; dependencies -- the smallest possible real case, and a fast build even
;; under --no-substitutes --rounds=2, which matters because this file was
;; written under AGENT-RESOURCE-POLICY.md's "machine already busy, defer"
;; rule (load average 4.01, 201Mi free RAM at write time, 2026-08-26) --
;; the definition itself costs no CPU, an actual `guix build` run does and
;; is deliberately deferred, not run here.
;;
;; Usage once evaluated:
;;   guix time-machine -C ../../channels.scm -- \
;;     build -f package.scm --no-substitutes --rounds=2
;; (channels.scm sits two directories up, at the my-lisp repo root --
;; verify it's still current before relying on it; last verified date is
;; recorded in that file itself, not duplicated here.)

;; module failed to resolve on this machine's Guix installation ("no code
;; for module"). Removed rather than left in as dead, untested code.
