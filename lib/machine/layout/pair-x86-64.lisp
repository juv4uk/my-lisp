; Lisp-owned x86-64 pair representation contract for the first native proof slice.
;
; The host owns only raw memory allocation and the call boundary. Lisp-authored
; machine lowering owns these field offsets and therefore owns the loads/stores
; that interpret the arena as a pair cell.
;
; This is deliberately not a general heap or GC ABI yet. The cell exists only
; for one native-call-u64-raw invocation and must not escape that call.
